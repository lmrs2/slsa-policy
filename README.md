## Overview

### What is SLSA?

[Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts](https://slsa.dev), or SLSA (salsa),
is a security framework, a check-list of standards and controls to prevent
tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure in your
projects, businesses or enterprises.

SLSA defines an incrementially adoptable set of levels which are defined in
terms of increasing compliance and assurance. SLSA levels are like a common
language to talk about how secure software, supply chains and their component
parts really are.

### What is provenance?

Provenance is information, or metadata, about how a software artifact was
created. This could include information about what source code, build system,
and build steps were used, as well as who and why the build was initiated.
Provenance can be used to determine the authenticity and trustworthiness of
software artifacts that you use.

As part of the framework, SLSA defines a
[provenance format](https://slsa.dev/provenance/) which can be used hold this
metadata.

### What is slsa-policy?

slsa-policy is an example Go library, CLI and set of GitHub Actions to implement source-to-deployment policies across an organization. The policy provides the following guarantees:

1. Containers (builds) are protected against tampering across the SDLC
2. Containers (builds) are bounds to a set of privileges, the same way that OS processes are restricted to a set of running privilages. In cloud environments,
  permissions are defined via IAM and are associated with Service Accounts (SAs) by the policy. For more details on the design, see [Technical design](#technical-design).

## End-to-end tutorial

For an end-to-end tutorial, follow the [SLSA workshop hosted at the 2024 Open Source Security Conference](https://github.com/slsa-framework/oss-na24-slsa-workshop).

The setup below are subset of the tutorial above, so we highly encourage you to follow hands-on activities of the workshop, available in the [link above](https://github.com/slsa-framework/oss-na24-slsa-workshop).

## Setup

### Publish policy

#### Org setup

##### Policy setup

1. Set up ACLs for your entire repository:
    1. Assign ownership via GitHub [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) for entire repository. Set the ownership to the administrators of the policy repository. It's important the workflows are also protected by CODEOWNERS.
    1. Enable [Repository Rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/managing-rulesets-for-a-repository) (formerly Branch Protection) for all branches. The following settings can be written as one rule, or [split into multiple rules](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets#about-rule-layering). They can be specified at the repository level, or the [organization level](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-rulesets-for-repositories-in-your-organization).
        1. Require a pull request before merging. Under additional settings: Require approvals (select at least 1-2 as the required number of approvals before merging).
        1. Require status checks to pass before merging. Under additional settings: Require branches to be up to date before merging (may be problematic for busy repos).
        1. Block force pushes
        1. Restrict deletions
        1. Limit any bypass actors to those that are strictly necessary (i.e. break glass).
        1. Require review from [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/available-rules-for-rulesets#additional-settings).
1. Add team maintainers as contributors to the repository. Give them `write` access. Do *NOT* give them admin access. Note that you can do that later when teams create their first policy, see [Policy definition](#policy-definition).
1. Create a folder to store the publish policies. See an example [here](https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/tree/main/policies/publish/).
1. Create a file with your trusted roots. See example [org.json](https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/tree/main/policies/publish/org.json).

##### Pre-submit validation

To validate the policy files, run the binary as:

```bash
cd policies/publish
$ go run . publish validate org.json .
```

TODO: we need pre-submits when new files are created, to ensure the appropriate owners are added to CODEOWNERS.

##### Publish service

You need to define a workflow that your teams will call when they want to publish their container images. This workflow is responsible for evaluating the publish policy. See an example [image-publisher.yml](https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/blob/main/.github/workflows/image-publisher.yml)

In the workflow above, the CLI is called as follows:

```bash
cd policies/publish
# This is passed by the caller, e.g. dev or prod.
env="${{ inputs.environment }}"
go run . publish evaluate org.json . "${image}" "${env}"
```

#### Team setup

##### Policy definition

Teams create their policy files under the folder defined by their organization in [Policy setup](#policy-setup). See an example of a policy in [echo-server.json](https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/blob/main/policies/publish/echo-server.json).

When a team creates a new file or folder:

1. If not already done in [Org setup](#org-setup), org administrators should add team members as contributors and give them `write` access. Do *NOT* gives them admin access.
1. Update the CODEOWNERS file to give permissions to the team members who own the package. This allows teams to edit their policies without requiring reviews by the organization admnistrators.

##### Call the publish service

When publishing containers, teams must call the publish policy service service [image-publisher.yml](https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/blob/main/.github/workflows/image-publisher.yml) defined in the org's [Publish service](#publish-service) section. See an example [deploy-image.yml](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-project/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-image.yml). This workflows would be called with environment set as "staging" first. One staging tests have passed, it may be called with "prod" environment. Note that the environment must match one the values defined in the policy definition [echo-server.json](https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/blob/main/policies/publish/echo-server.json).

After the workflow has successfully run, you may manually verify the publish attestation via:

```bash
# NOTE: change image to your image.
$ image=docker.io/slsa-framework/slsa-project-echo-server@sha256:4378b3d11e11ede0f64946e588c590e460e44f90c8a7921ad2cb7b04aaf298d4
$ creator_id=https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/.github/workflows/image-publisher.yml@refs/heads/main
$ type=https://slsa.dev/publish/v0.1
$ cosign verify-attestation "${image}" \
    --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
    --certificate-identity "${creator_id}" 
    --type "${type}" | jq -r '.payload' | base64 -d | jq
```

### Deployment policy

#### Org setup

##### Policy setup

1. Set up ACLs for your entire repository:
    1. Assign ownership via GitHub [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) for entire repository. Set the ownership to the administrators of the policy repository. It's important the workflows are also protected by CODEOWNERS.
    1. Enable [Repository Rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/managing-rulesets-for-a-repository) (formerly Branch Protection) for all branches. The following settings can be written as one rule, or [split into multiple rules](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets#about-rule-layering). They can be specified at the repository level, or the [organization level](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-rulesets-for-repositories-in-your-organization).
        1. Require a pull request before merging. Under additional settings: Require approvals (select at least 1-2 as the required number of approvals before merging).
        1. Require status checks to pass before merging. Under additional settings: Require branches to be up to date before merging (may be problematic for busy repos).
        1. Block force pushes
        1. Restrict deletions
        1. Limit any bypass actors to those that are strictly necessary (i.e. break glass).
        1. Require review from [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/available-rules-for-rulesets#additional-settings).
1. Add team maintainers as contributors to the repository. Give them `write` access. Do *NOT* give them admin access. Note that you can do that later when teams create their first policy, see [Policy definition](#policy-definition).
1. Create a folder to store the deployment policies. See an example [here](https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/tree/main/policies/deployment/).
1. Create a file with your trusted roots. See example [org.json](https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/tree/main/policies/deployment/org.json).

##### Pre-submit validation

To validate the policy files, run the binary as:

```bash
cd policies/deployment
$ go run . deployment validate org.json .
```

TODO: we need pre-submits when new files are created, to ensure the appropriate owners are added to CODEOWNERS.

##### Deployer workflow

You need to define a workflow that your teams will call when they want to deploy their container images. This workflow is responsible for evaluating the deployment policy. See an example [image-deployer.yml](https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/blob/main/.github/workflows/image-deployer.yml)

In the workflow above, the CLI is called as follows:

```bash
cd policies/deployment
# This expands to https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/.github/workflows/image-deployer.yml@refs/heads/main
creator_id="https://github.com/${{ needs.detect-env.outputs.repository }}/.github/workflows/image-deployer.yml@${{ needs.detect-env.outputs.ref }}"
# This is provided by the caller. It is the unique path to the policy, e.g. servers-dev.json
policy_id="${{ inputs.policy-id }}"
go run . deployment evaluate org.json . "${image}" "${policy_id}" "${creator_id}"
```

#### Project setup

##### Policy definition

Teams create their policy files under the folder defined by their organization in [Policy setup](#policy-setup-1). See an example of a policy in [servers-prod.json](https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/blob/main/policies/deployment/servers-prod.json).

When a team creates a new file or folder:

1. If not already done in [Org setup](#org-setup-1), org administrators should add team members as contributors and give them `write` access. Do *NOT* gives them admin access.
1. Update the CODEOWNERS file to give permissions to the team members who own the package. This allows teams to edit their policies without requiring reviews by the organization admnistrators.

##### Call the deployment service

Before submitting a request to deploy containers, teams must call the deployment policy service [image-deployer.yml](https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/blob/main/.github/workflows/image-deployer.yml) defined in the org's [Deployment service](#deployment-service) section. See an example [deploy-image.yml](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-project/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-image.yml). This may be called with "staging" environment first to allow the container to run on the staging service account defined in [servers-staging.json](https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/blob/main/policies/deployment/servers-staging.json). Once all staging tests have passed, it may be called with "prod" environment. Note that the environment must match one the values defined in the publish policy file [servers-prod.json](https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/blob/main/policies/deployment/servers-prod.json) and the deployment policy file [echo-server.json](https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/blob/main/policies/publish/echo-server.json).

After the workflow has successfully run, you may manually verify the publish attestation via:

```bash
# NOTE: change image to your image.
$ image=docker.io/slsa-framework/slsa-project-echo-server@sha256:4378b3d11e11ede0f64946e588c590e460e44f90c8a7921ad2cb7b04aaf298d4
$ creator_id=https://github.com/lmrs2/bh25-organization/blob/main/.github/workflows/image-deployer.yml@refs/heads/main
$ type=https://slsa.dev/deployment/v0.1
$ cosign verify-attestation "{$image}" \
    --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
    --certificate-identity "${creator_id}" 
    --type "${type}" | jq -r '.payload' | base64 -d | jq
```

This verification will be performed by the admission controller. See [Admission controller](#admission-controller).

### Admission controller

The admisson controller is responsible for verifying the deployment attestation:
1. Verify the signature
1. Verify each scope `google_service_account` == google service account the pod run under
